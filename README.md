# Orbiter Space Flight Simulator

Orbiter is a spaceflight simulator based on Newtonian mechanics. Its playground
is our solar system with many of its major bodies – the sun, planets and moons.
You take control of a spacecraft – either historic, hypothetical, or purely
science fiction. Orbiter is unlike most commercial computer games with a space
theme – there are no predefined missions to complete (except the ones you set
yourself), no aliens to destroy and no goods to trade. Instead, you will get a
pretty good idea about what is involved in real space flight – how to plan an
ascent into orbit, how to rendezvous with a space station, or how to fly to
another planet. It is more difficult, but also more of a challenge. Some people
get hooked, others get bored. Finding out for yourself is easy – simply give it
a try. Orbiter is free, so you don’t need to invest more than a bit of your
spare time.

## License

Orbiter is now published as an Open Source project under the MIT License (see
[LICENSE](./LICENSE) file for details).

D3D9Client graphics engine is licensed under LGPL, see [LGPL](./OVP/D3D9Client/LGPL.txt)

## Installation

Get the Orbiter source repository from github
```bash
git clone git@github.com:orbitersim/orbiter.git
```
or
```bash
git clone https://github.com/orbitersim/orbiter.git
```

To configure and generate the makefiles, you need a recent
[CMake](https://cmake.org/download/).

To compile Orbiter from its sources, you need
[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).
Orbiter has been successfully built with VS Community 2019, but other versions should
also work. Note that VS2019 comes with built-in CMake support, so you don't
need a separate CMake installation.

Some configuration caveats:
- If you are using the [Ninja](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/generator/Ninja.html)
generator (default for the VS built-in CMake), you may also need
[vspkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg) to configure the VS toolset.
- If you are using the VS2019 generator, you may need to set up Visual Studio to use
only a single thread for the build. This is because some of the build tools (especially
those for generating the Orbiter documentation) are not threadsafe, and the VS2019
generator doesn't understand the CMake JOB_POOL directive.

Orbiter is a 32-bit application. Be sure to configure vspkg and CMake accordingly.

If you want to build the documentation, you need a few additional tools:
- a filter to convert ODT and DOC sources to PDF, such as
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/).
- a LaTeX compiler suite such as [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download).
- [Doxygen](https://www.doxygen.nl/index.html) for building the source-level
  documentation for developers.

By default, the build is configured to create both graphics flavours of the
Orbiter executable (although this can be configured with the ORBITER_GRAPHICS CMake flag):
- ``orbiter.exe`` is the standalone Orbiter application with built-in DX7 graphics.
- ``orbiter_ng.exe`` is a launcher for ``./Modules/Server/orbiter.exe`` which is the
graphics server version of Orbiter. It requires an external graphics client
plugin to be loaded via the Modules tab of the Orbiter Launchpad dialog.
The reference D3D7Client is included with the build with essentially the same
functionality as the built-in graphics version. Use 3rd party client
implementations to make use of more modern graphics engines.

See [README.compile](./README.compile) for details on building Orbiter.

## Planet textures

The Orbiter git repository does not include most of the planetary texture files
required for running Orbiter.
You need to install those separately. The easiest way to do so is by installing
[Orbiter 2016](http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/download.html). Optionally you can
also install high-resolution versions of the textures from the Orbiter website.
You should keep the Orbiter 2016 installation separate from your Orbiter git
repository.

To configure Orbiter to use the 2016 texture installation, set the
ORBITER_PLANET_TEXTURE_INSTALL_DIR entry in CMake. For example, if Orbiter 2016
was installed in `C:\Orbiter2016`, the CMake option should be set to
`C:/Orbiter2016/Textures`.
Alternatively, you can configure the texture directory after building Orbiter
by setting the `PlanetTexDir` entry in `Orbiter.cfg`.

## Help

Help files are located in the Doc subfolder (if you built them). Orbiter.pdf is the
main Orbiter user manual.

The in-game help system can be opened via the "Help" button on
the Orbiter Launchpad dialog, or with Alt-F1 while running
Orbiter.

Remaining questions can be posted on the Orbiter user forum at
[orbiter-forum.com](https://www.orbiter-forum.com).
